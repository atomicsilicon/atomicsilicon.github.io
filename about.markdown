I'm a entrepreneur and a computer scientist. This blog, Atomic Silicon, is a space for me to share my thoughts, and capture my reflections on things that affect the business I'm trying to build, the technology and cybersecurity industry that is kind enough to let me dwell in. Oh, and the life I'm leading in general.

In a way I don't expect anyone to see this. If you do stumble across this, hello! ðŸ‘‹

The pleasure is truly mine.
